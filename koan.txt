To install on systems using BSD fortune(6), rename this file "koan" and
store it in the appropriate fortunes directory, usually /usr/games/fortune
or /usr/share/fortune or something like that. Then in that directory run
strfile(8) on the "koan" file which should produce a "koan.dat". To
test, go to some other directory with no file called "koan" in it, and
say "fortune lambda". If you get a lispy fortune you win. If not you lose.
To install on other systems simply find a fortune program, install it, and
then install this file. Or write your own fortune program in Lisp.

== Qingyuan's Whisk ==
Zen master Qingyuan Xingsi [Hongji] of Jingju Monastery once asked Zen master Xiqian
of Shitou [Wuji], “Where are you from?” 
   Shitou said, “I am from Caoxi [where the Sixth Ancestor taught].”
   Master Qingyuan held up a whisk and said, “Do they have this in Caoxi?” 
   Shitou said, “Not in Caoxi, nor in India.” 
   The master said, “You haven’t been to India, have you?” 
   Shitou said, “If I had been there, it would have been there.” 
   The master said, “If you haven’t been there, how can you say that?”
   Shitou said, “Master, you should say something rather than letting me say it all.” 
   The master said, “It’s not that I mind saying something, but I fear it would be
misunderstood later.”

Once, Lecturer Liang of Mount Xi studied with Mazu, who said, “Which sūtra do you
teach?” 
   Liang said, “The Heart/Mind Sūtra.”
   Mazu said, “How do you teach it?”
   Liang said, “I teach it with the mind.” 
   Mazu said, “The mind is like an actor. The will is like a supporting actor. The objects of
the six senses are like their company. How can they teach this sūtra?”
   Liang said, “If the mind can’t teach it, can emptiness teach it?” 
   Mazu said, “Yes, emptiness can teach it.” 
   Liang flipped his sleeves and walked away. 
   Mazu called out, “Lecturer!” 
   Liang turned his head. 
   Mazu said, “From birth till death, it’s just this.”  At that moment Liang had realization. 
He hid himself at Mount Xi [J., Sei] and was not heard from again.
%
== Layman Pangyun’s Awakening ==
Layman Pangyun asked Shitou upon his first meeting with the teacher, “Who is the one
who does not accompany all things?” 
   Shitou covered Pangyun’s mouth with his hand. 
   Pangyun had some understanding at this point. 
   Later he repeated the same question to Mazu. 
   Mazu said, “Wait till you swallow up the Xi River in a single gulp, then I will tell you.” 
   Pangyun was immediately awakened.
%
== Master Langye’s “Original Purity” ==

the great earth suddenly appear?”
%

enlightenment?”

%
== Nanyue Polishes a Brick ==
Zen master Mazu Daoyi was an attendant to Nanyue and personally received the mind
seal from him, exceeding his peers. Before that, he lived in Kaiyuan Monastery and did
zazen all day long. Knowing that Mazu was a dharma vessel, Nanyue went to him and
asked, “Great monastic, what do you intend by doing zazen?” 
   Mazu said, “I am intending to be a buddha.” 
   Nanyue picked up a brick and started polishing it. 
   Mazu said, “What are you doing?” 
   Nanyue said, “I am trying to make a mirror.” 
   Mazu said, “How can you make a mirror by polishing a brick?” 
   Nanyue said, “How can you become a buddha by doing zazen?” 
   Mazu said, “What do you mean by that?” 
   Nanyue said, “Think about driving a cart. When it stops moving, do you whip the cart or
the horse?”
   Mazu said nothing.
   Nanyue said, “Do you want to practice sitting Zen or sitting Buddha? If you understand
sitting Zen, you will know that Zen is not about sitting or lying down. If you want to learn
sitting Buddha, know that sitting Buddha is without any fixed form. Do not use
discrimination in the non-abiding dharma. If you practice sitting as Buddha, you must kill
Buddha. If you are attached to the sitting form, you are not yet mastering the essential
principle.”
   Mazu heard this admonition and felt as if he had tasted sweet nectar.

== Minister Peixiu Sees a Portrait ==
Huangbo once left his assembly at Mount Huangbo and entered Daan Temple. There he
joined the workers who cleaned the halls. Once, Minister Peixiu visited the temple to
offer incense and was greeted by the temple director. Peixiu looked at a mural on the
wall and said, “What kind of painting is that?” 
   The director said, “It is a portrait of a high monastic.” 
   Peixiu said, “Obviously it is a portrait. But where is the high monastic?” 
   The director could not answer.
   Peixiu said, “Is there a Zen person around here?”
   The director said, “A monastic has been working in this temple. He seems to be a Zen
person.”
   Peixiu said, “Could you ask him to come so I can ask him questions?” Huangbo was
quickly brought to the minister, who was happy to see him. The minister said, “I have a
question, but all the masters I have asked this question of have been unable to answer it.
   Reverend, would you please respond to it?”
   Huangbo said, “Please present your question, my lord.”
   Peixiu repeated the question he had asked the temple director.
   Huangbo raised his voice, called out and said, “Minister!” 
   Peixiu responded, “Yes?” 
   Huangbo said, “Where are you?” 
   Peixiu immediately understood. It was just like finding a pearl in his own hair. He said
to Huangbo, “You are a true master.” Then he asked Huangbo to open the teaching hall
and let him enter.

%
== Zhaozhou’s “Losing the Mind in Confusion” ==
Zhaozhou said to the assembly, “‘If you have even a bit of discrimination, you lose your
mind in confusion.’ Do you have anything to say about this?” 
   A monastic hit Zhaozhou’s attendant and said, “Why don’t you answer the master?” 
   Zhaozhou left and went back to the abbot’s room. Later the attendant asked Zhaozhou
for guidance and said, “Did that monastic who struck me have understanding, or did he
not?” 
   Zhaozhou said, “The one who sits sees the one who stands; the one who stands sees
the one who sits.”

   Xuansha said, “The entire world of the ten directions is one bright pearl. Why is it
necessary to understand the meaning of this?” 
   On the following day Xuansha said to the monastic, “The entire world of the ten
directions is one bright pearl. How do you understand the meaning of this?” 
The monastic replied, “The entire world of the ten directions is one bright pearl. Why is
it necessary to understand the meaning of this?”

mountain.”

great earth?” 
%
== Xiangyan’s Great Enlightenment ==
Zen master Zhixian of Mount Xiangyan [Xideng] was bright in nature. Being at the
assembly of Guishan, he was well learned and had extensive memory. 
   Guishan one day said to Xiangyan, “Everything you say is what you’ve memorized from
commentaries. Now I am going to ask you a question. When you were an infant—before
you could even distinguish east from west—at that time, how was it?” 
   Xiangyan spoke and presented his understanding, explaining the principle, but could
not get approval. He went through the texts he had collected and studied, but he could
not find an answer that would satisfy the master. 
   Deeply grieved and in tears, he burned all his books and commentaries. Then he said
to himself, “I will never understand Zen in this lifetime. I will become a hermit monastic
and enter a mountain and practice.” 
   Thus he entered Mount Wudang and built a hut near the grave site of National Teacher
Nanyang. One day while he was sweeping the path, a pebble struck a stalk of bamboo
and made a cracking sound. At that moment he suddenly had a great enlightenment
experience. He wrote a poem expressing his understanding:

	    One crack and all knowledge has dissolved.
	    The struggle is over.
	    I follow the ancient Way, not lapsing into doubt.
	    Dignified bearing and conduct
	    	      that is beyond sound and form;
	    	 no trace remains of my passing.
	    Those who have mastered the Way
	    	  call this the unsurpassable activity. 
		  
   He presented this poem to Guishan, who said, “This fellow has penetrated it
completely.” 
%
== Nanquan and the Land Deity ==
Zen master Puyuan of Mount Nanquan [family name Wang], once visited a village. For
this occasion the village headsman had made arrangements to welcome him beforehand.
   Nanquan said, “Usually my coming and going is not known about by others, how is it that
you knew of my coming and prepared for it like this?” 
   The headsman said, “Last night the deity of this land told us that you were coming.” 
   Nanquan said, “Master Wang has not practiced hard enough and was seen by a spirit.” 
   His attendant said, “You are a master of great knowledge. Why is it that you were
noticed by a spirit?” 
   Nanquan said, “Offer a bowl of rice to the land deity.” 
%
== “Ordinary Mind Is the Way” ==
Zhaozhou asked Nanquan, “What is the Way?” Nanquan said, “Ordinary mind is the
Way.” 
   Zhaozhou said, “Shall I try to direct myself toward it?” 
   Nanquan said, “If you try to direct yourself toward it, you will move away from it.” 
   Zhaozhou said, “If I don’t try, how will I know it’s the Way?” 
   Nanquan said, “The Way is not concerned with knowing or not knowing. Knowing is
illusion; not knowing is blank consciousness. If you truly arrive at the Great Way of no
trying, it will be like great emptiness, vast and clear. How can we speak of it in terms of
affirming or negating?” 
   Zhaozhou immediately realized the profound teaching. 
%
== Changsha’s “Stop Illusory Thinking” ==
Changsha was once asked by Emperor’s Secretary Du, “When you chop an earthworm
into two pieces, both pieces keep moving. I wonder, in which piece is the buddha
nature?” 
   Changsha said, “Don’t have illusory thoughts.” 
   Du said, “How are we to understand that they are both moving?” 
   Changsha said, “Understand that air and fire are not yet scattered.” 
   Du said nothing. 
   Changsha called Du, and Du responded, “Yes?” 
   Changsha said, “Isn’t this your true self?” 
   Du said, “Apart from my answering, is there another true self?” 
   Changsha said, “I can’t call you Emperor.”
   Du said, “If so, would my not answering also be my true self?” 
   Changsha said, “It’s not a matter of answering me or not. But since the beginningless
kalpa, the question to answer or not has been the root of birth and death.” Then he
recited a verse:
	Students of the Way don’t know the truth.
	They only know their past consciousness.
	This is the basis of endless birth and death.
	The deluded call it the original self.
%
== Panshan’s “Cut a Fine Piece” ==
Once Zen master Baoji of Panshan [Ningji] went to the marketplace and overheard a

      When emptiness comes, shuck it. 
   Once, Linji sent a monastic to grab Puhua and say, “What will you do when no-
brightness and no-darkness come?” 
   Puhua pushed back the monastic and said, “In a few days there will be a meal offering
at the Dabei Temple [Great Compassion Temple].” 
   The monastic went back and reported this to Linji, who said, “I have always wondered
about that fellow.” 
%
== Yangshan’s “High and Low” ==
One day Zen master Huiji of Yangshan [Tongzhi] joined his teacher Guishan in plowing
the rice field. Yangshan said, “Master, this place is low. How can I level it with the higher
place?” 
   Guishan said, “Water is level, so why not use water and make the entire field level?” 
   Yangshan said, “Water is not necessary. Master, high places are level as high and low
places are level as low.” 
   Guishan approved. 
%
== Dasui’s “Great Kalpa Fire” ==
Zen master Fazhen of Mount Dasui [Shenzhao] was once asked by a monastic, “It is said

== Linji's Enlightenment ==
Zen master Yixuan of Linji Monastery [Huizhao] had been at the assembly of Huangbo
practicing single-mindedly for three years. 
   The head monastic admired him, saying, “He is young, but there is something special
about him.” He sent Linji to the abbot (Huangbo) and had him ask, “What, exactly, is the
essential meaning of the Buddhadharma?” 
   Linji went to the master as instructed. Before he had finished speaking, Huangbo hit
him. Linji asked the question three times, and Huangbo hit him three times. 
   Linji went back to the head monastic and said, “You compassionately advised me to
ask a question of the master. I asked three times and was hit three times. I regret that
something keeps me from understanding his profound teaching. I am leaving here
today.” 
   The head monastic said, “If you are leaving, you should bid farewell to the master.”
   The head monastic went first to the master and said, “The young man who asked you a
question fits the dharma. If he comes to bid farewell to you, please guide him with skillful
means. Later he will manifest as a huge tree and provide shade for the world.” 
   Linji went up to the abbot’s room to bid him farewell. Huangbo said, “Don’t go
anywhere other than Gao’an Dayu’s place.”
   Linji visited Gao’an, who asked him where he was from. Linji said, “Huangbo’s.”
   Gao’an said, “What did Huangbo have to say?”
   Linji said, “I asked him a question three times and was hit three times. I don’t know if I
was wrong or not.”
   Gao’an said, “Huangbo had such a grandmotherly heart. He exhausted himself for you.
   Why do you ask if you were wrong or not?” 
   Linji immediately had an awakening and said, “Huangbo’s Buddhadharma is not so
extraordinary.” 
   Gao’an pushed him down and said, “You devil in the toilet! A few moments ago you
were wondering if you had been wrong or not. Now you are saying that Huangbo’s
dharma is not extraordinary. What principle do you see? Say it. Say it!” 
   Linji punched Gao’an’s ribs three times.
   Gao’an pushed him back and said, “Your teacher is Huangbo. I have nothing to do with
you.”
   Linji left Gao’an and returned to Huangbo, who said, “You come and go. When is it
going to stop?” 
   Linji said, “Just because your old grandmotherly heart is profound.” He made a bow
and stood next to the master.
   Huangbo said, “Where did you go?”
   Linji said, “Following your direction, I went to see Gao’an.”
   Huangbo said, “What did he say?” Linji told the story.
   Huangbo said, “If that guy comes to me, I will give him a set of severe blows.”
   Linji said, “Why do you talk about waiting? Do it now.” Then he hit the master. 
   Huangbo said, “You crazy monastic, coming here and grabbing the tiger’s whiskers!”
   Linji shouted. 
   Huangbo said to his attendant monastic, “Take this crazy monastic and show him to
the monastics’ hall.”

   Caoshan said, “Dry all the way.”

   Caoshan said, “Throughout the entire earth, there is no one who does not hear it.”

while. I am afraid if the head monastic finds out about this he will make trouble for you.”

   Qingzhu, told him the story, and asked for guidance.

== Where Wisdom Cannot Reach ==
Zen master Zongzhi [Yuanzhi] of Mount Daowu left Yaoshan and went to visit Nanquan. Nanquan said, “Reverend, what is your name?” 1
   Daowu said, “Zongzhi [source wisdom].” 2
   Nanquan said, “Where wisdom does not reach, what do you make of the source?”
   Daowu said, “I would rather not speak.” 3
   Nanquan said, “Bright and clear; but if you speak of it, horns will emerge.” 4
   Three days later, Daowu was in the washroom, sewing with Yunyan. Passing by, Nanquan saw him and said, “The other day you said that you would rather not say it. And I said, ‘If you say it, horns will emerge.’ How then do you practice?” 5
   Daowu left and entered the monastics’ hall. 6 Then Nanquan went away. Daowu came back and sat down.
   Yunyan said, “Senior brother, why didn’t you answer the master?” 7
   Daowu said, “How come you are so brilliant?” 8
   Yunyan did not press further. He went to [see] Nanquan and said, “[About the question of the other day], why did Ascetic Zhi [Daowu] not answer you?” 9
   Nanquan said, “He practices among other types of beings.” 10
   Yunyan said, “What is practicing among other types of beings?” 11
   Nanquan said, “Don’t you see what was said? ‘Where wisdom does not reach.’ ‘I prefer not to say it.’ ‘If you say it, then horns will emerge.’ Thus you go toward different types of beings.” 12
   Yunyan did not understand it. Seeing that Yunyan did not accept it, Nanquan said, “This person does not have a reason to stay here.” 13
   Both [Daowu and Yunyan] went back to Yaoshan. Yaoshan saw them return and asked
   Yunyan, “Where have you been?”
   Yunyan said, “I have been with Nanquan.”
   Yaoshan said, “What did Nanquan say?” Yunyan told him the story.
   Yaoshan said, “How did you understand his teaching at that time?” Yunyan said nothing, and Yaoshan laughed hard. 14 Yunyan said, “What is practicing among other types of beings?” 15
   Yaoshan said, “I am tired today. Come back some other time.” 16
   Yunyan said, “I have come back specifically for this matter.” 17
   Yaoshan said, “Go away for now.” 18 Yunyan left.
   Outside the abbot’s room, Daowu, overhearing Yaoshan’s not confirming Yunyan’s understanding, bit his finger to bleeding without noticing. He went back to Yunyan and said, “Junior brother, what did you say to the master [Yaoshan]? How was it?”
   Yunyan said, “The master did not answer me.” 19 Daowu bowed. 20
   Later, when Daowu and Yunyan were with Yaoshan, Yaoshan said, “Where wisdom does not reach, you prefer not to say. If you say it, horns will emerge.” 21
   Daowu thanked him and went away. 22
   Yunyan finally asked Yaoshan, “Why did [my] senior brother Zhi [Daowu] not answer you?” 23
   Yaoshan said, “I have a backache today. 24 Daowu understands this matter. Go and ask him.” 25
   Yunyan went [to Daowu] and said, “Senior brother, why did you not answer the master?” 26
   Daowu said, “I have a headache. Go and ask the master.” 27
   Later, before passing away, Yunyan sent his last words to Daowu. 28 Daowu read them and said, “I did not know that Yunyan had it. 29 I regret that I did not say it to him at that time. Even so, he was still an heir of Yaoshan.” 30
